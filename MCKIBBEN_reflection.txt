#These are my reflection questions for Lab 5

1. I am working on it, but no it wouldn't. My lab documents are largely paper based and only uploaded as images.
	I am working on the coded sections of my work to make it more reproducible. It takes a long time and debugging code makes me sad.

2. Non-reproducible work in the computational fields is harmful as it inhibits the ability for others to try your work and validate it.
	It also makes incorporating your data into other analyses more difficult and reduces the scope of your contributions.

3. Even in microbiomics and functional genomics, data analysis is too large and multi-faceted to be done by hand. When data analysis is done almost solely by computer, those analyses need to be documented and repeatable.
