I think that storing our documents and code is critical to the reproducibility of the researh. If we save our work properly and include meaningful comments to our code, we can help and navigate other researches to repeat, i.e. reproduce the same methods accurately so that they can continue developing a particular research area. Similarly, if we are in the position to repeat somebody else's work for the sake of our own research, we need to have a starting point or a pool of information which serves as a very powerful instrument. In the field of computational biology and bioinformatics this non-reproducible research affects the overall area and leads to contraints. How would a single researcher that is doing comparative genomics and is focusing on a butterfly species in the United States with a closely related butterly species in Mexico if none of these researchers stores a reproducible code? It will probably be very hard for them to repeat each other's work. Hence, reproducibility is critical to many aspects of computational biology and it makes collaborative work transparent and stronger. In my specific field of study, I am interested in the effects of the environment on life history trade-offs in the Gopher tortoise. I will be investigatng the effects of the environment on the chromosomal DNA, particularly how telomeres lenght is affected over time and between males and females. So, having a well-documented reproducible code will help other researchers who are doing the same work to produce strong data and draw meaningful conclusions.
