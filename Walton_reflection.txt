Lab 5 Reflection Questions:

Reflect on how you currently manage your documents and code, particularly content associated
 with publishable work. Would it stand up to a reproducibility test?
 How do you think non-reproducibile research affects computational biology and
 bioinformatics? What about in your specific field of study?

Answer:
Quite honestly, it probably wouldn't stand up to a reproducibility test -- I have
folders with random names, files that are important with names that don't really 
suggest so, etc.
Non-reproducible research is drastically holding back the field of computational 
biology and bioinformatics. Reproducbility is at the core of research in general,
so in a way, having non-reproducible code is like having non-reproducible methods,
meaning non-reproducible code reduces the merit and credibility of the research.
Within my specific field of study, non-reproducible research is very bad, to be blunt.
Since so many concepts and new information is built off of previous information and 
findings, then the methods and analyses MUST be reproducible in order to move forward
in the field.
